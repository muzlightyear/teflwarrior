# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# teflwarrior
This is a teaching tool I decided to make with my newfound skills of JS/HTML/CSS.

Having been a teacher for 6 years and constantly struggling with the issue of choosing activities in my classrooms, this app was a no-brainer to make. 

Current functionality:
- There are 4 words of the week (from easy-medium-hard-extreme).

-You can choose between Describe, Play or Draw which will take the results from one of three different arrays and give you a randomized result. 

Future plans:
-I plan to remake this app in React & release it to the public.
-Users will be able to add to the arrays to increase the randomization.
-Users will be able to suggest words of the week.
-Some of the 'Play' options will be able to be played on the actual website (e.g Hangman).
