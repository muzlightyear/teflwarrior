This is a teaching tool I decided to make with my newfound skills of JS/HTML/CSS.

Having been a teacher for 6 years and constantly struggling with the issue of choosing activities in my classrooms, this app was a no-brainer to make. 

Current functionality:
- There are 4 words of the week (from easy-medium-hard-extreme).

-You can choose between Describe, Play or Draw which will take the results from one of three different arrays and give you a randomized result. 

Future plans:
-I plan to remake this app in React & release it to the public.
-Users will be able to add to the arrays to increase the randomization.
-Users will be able to suggest words of the week.
-Some of the 'Play' options will be able to be played on the actual website (e.g Hangman).
